# Project Overview

This project aims to deepen our understanding of Java as a programming language, explore blockchain as a Web3 concept, and reinforce principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). By leveraging core components from these three domains, we have designed and implemented a blockchain application that showcases the practical integration of various programming concepts and technologies.

## Objectives

1. **Java Proficiency**: 
   - Enhance coding skills in Java by developing a comprehensive application that incorporates various language features, including classes, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Explore Java's data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage blockchain data.

2. **Blockchain Understanding**:
   - Gain insights into the fundamental principles of blockchain technology, including block structure, mining processes, and transaction validation.
   - Understand how blockchain operates as a decentralized ledger and its applications in the Web3 ecosystem.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Apply OOP principles to structure the blockchain application, ensuring code modularity, reusability, and maintainability.
   - Implement design patterns that facilitate cleaner code architecture and easier scalability.

## Libraries Used

We utilized the following libraries to enhance the functionality of our project:

1. **GSON Library**:
   - This library is used to convert Java objects into their JSON representation and vice versa. GSON simplifies the serialization and deserialization processes, allowing us to easily store and transmit blockchain data in a human-readable format.
   - By leveraging GSON, we can effectively print the blockchain and its transactions, facilitating debugging and data inspection.

2. **Bouncy Castle**:
   - Bouncy Castle provides a robust framework of cryptographic algorithms and protocols, which are essential for implementing security features in our blockchain application.
   - We utilize Bouncy Castle to perform cryptographic operations, specifically for creating and verifying digital signatures using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). This ensures the integrity and authenticity of transactions within our blockchain.

## Cryptography

In this project, we employed the SHA-256 hashing algorithm for encryption, which is a critical component of the blockchain. SHA-256 serves several purposes:

- It generates a unique hash for each block, linking them securely and forming the basis of the blockchain’s integrity.
- It ensures that any modification to the block’s data results in a different hash, making it easy to detect tampering or unauthorized changes.

## Conclusion

Through this project, we have developed a deeper understanding of Java programming, blockchain technology, and object-oriented design principles. We have gained hands-on experience with powerful libraries that facilitate efficient data handling and security, equipping us with valuable skills for future endeavors in software development and blockchain applications.
