This project's main aim is to enhance the unerstanding of JAVA as a programming language, BlockChain as a Web3 Concept and OOPS.
We have leveraged the core components in all three domains and extracted this project.
We have also learnt the usage of libraries and how to implement them in JAVA, the libraries used in this project are:
1) GSON library (converts Java objects into their JSON representation and vice versa)
2) BouncyCastle (provides various cryptographic algorithms and protocols)
